# cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api

## Status

**This package has now been rewritten, substantially improved and released as the `laravel-json-api/laravel` package.**
Documentation for the new version is available on our new website [laraveljsonapi.io](https://laraveljsonapi.io) and the
code is now developed under the
[Laravel JSON:API Github organisation.](https://github.com/laravel-json-api)

The `cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api` package is now considered to be the *legacy* package. As we know it is in use in
a lot of production applications, it will continue to receive bug fixes and updates for new Laravel versions. However,
it is no longer supported for new features.

**If you are starting a new project, please use the
[new package `laravel-json-api/laravel` instead.](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/laravel)**

### What is JSON API?

From [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)

> If you've ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON API is your
> anti-bikeshedding weapon.
>
> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on
> what matters: your application. Clients built around JSON API are able to take advantage of its features around
> efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.

For full information on the spec, plus examples, see [http://jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org).
