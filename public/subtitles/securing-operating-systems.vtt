00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.440
As systems grow powerful attacks on systems grow
more sophisticated, and no amount of security

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.280
measures may completely avert the attacks.
But security measures do help in mitigating

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.520
the attacks therefore it is important that the
system users secure the computer from threats.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.320
This module talks about securing
a system from such threats.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:38.240
This module will familiarize you with: one,
system security. Two, threads to system security.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.640
Three, guidelines for windows or
security and four window security tools.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.040
System Security

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.920
System security is a requirement for accessing
various applications and downloads in enterprises.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.280
System security is a major concern to
organizations and users as it may contain

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.360
sensitive data. The system has various issues such
as malicious software, hardware/software failure,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:28.160
malicious user or attacker, user error, phishing,
and theft or vandalism. Issues related to system

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.120
security include every operating system and
application is subject to security flaws

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.520
because every day attackers are finding new attack
codes to attack the operating systems. Software

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.720
vendors usually develop patches to address
these flaws which are usually caused by the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.800
uneven architecture during the developing phase.
The user has to obtain and install the patches

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.120
and configure the software which updates system
protection and maintain an unaffected performance.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.920
System compromise can be prevented by
applying security patches in a timely manner.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.560
Threats to System Security

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.240
Specific threats one should be aware of for
system security include: First, a virus.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.840
A virus is a program that replicates
by copying itself to other programs.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.120
System boot sectors are documents and alters
or damages to computer files and applications.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080
A computer virus can do anything from popping
up a short message to wiping key files so that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.960
your computer does not work. Some viruses may
cause direct damage to your files by deleting

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.880
or corrupting them. Viruses can also use system
resources and reduce computer speed by affecting

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.760
the computer or network. Some viruses may display
rude political or strange messages on the screen.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:20.240
Some viruses can allow other people to access
and perhaps control your computer. Next is worm.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.040
A worm is a self-replicating virus
that does not alter files but resides

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.000
in computer memory and replicates itself.
A computer worm is similar to a computer virus

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.360
however unlike virus it does not require
user intervention to replicate as it is a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.200
self-replicating computer program. A virus works
by attaching itself to another executable file;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.680
a worm does not have to be part of another
program to propagate itself and is designed

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.240
to exploit the file transfer activities on target
systems. In addition to replication, a worm can

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.480
cause further harm such as deleting files on the
victim system or sending documents via email.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.360
A worm can wreck havoc with the network traffic
generated by its reproduction. For example,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.840
the Mydoom worm caused a noticeable worldwide
internet slowdown at the peak of its spread.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.000
Next is Backdoor

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.560
A backdoor is an unauthorized
means of accessing a system

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.640
and bypassing the security mechanisms. An
effective backdoor allows an attacker to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.960
retain access to an infected machine even though
the system administrator detects the intrusion.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.280
Next on the list is a Trojan.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.880
A trojan is a program that seems to be
legitimate but acts maliciously when executed.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.560
It can damage or erase information on the hard
drive. It can also open a discrete entry point

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.240
for an attacker to revisit and own the system. A
trojan can, thus, permit an attacker to use the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.360
victim's system for further attacks. Data can be
stolen and manipulated. In contrast the attacker

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.840
may use the system's resources such as hard disk
space to distribute illegal material over the net.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.800
Next is Logic Bomb.
A logic bomb is a code that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.160
is surreptitiously inserted into an application
or operating system that causes it to perform

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.800
a destructive or security compromising
activity wherever specific conditions are met.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.560
Spyware
A spyware includes trojans and other malicious

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.640
software that steals personal information
from a system without the user's knowledge.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.680
It can result in an undesired
advertising information

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.160
or pop-ads in particular the rerouting of page
requests to illegally claim commercial site

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.680
referral fees and even the installation of stealth
phone dialers. Some software providers bundle

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.160
secondary programs to collect data or distribute
advertisement content without explicitly informing

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.880
the user about the real purpose of those
programs. These secondary software programs

00:06:50.880 --> 00:07:01.840
can that drastically impair or degrade system
performance and consume network resources.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.520
Keylogger
A keylogger is a hardware device or small

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.760
software program that monitors and records
each keystroke on a user's computer keyboard.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.680
It can be used by an attacker to capture
confidential information for later use. This means

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.920
a key logger can be used to find out everything
a person types into a computer including personal

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.360
letters, business correspondence,
passwords, and credit card numbers.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.840
Password Cracking
A password cracking is the process of identifying

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.880
or recovering an unknown or forgotten password.
The malicious intent behind password cracking

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.760
is to gain unauthorized access to a system. A
password cracker is an application program that

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:02.400
is used to identify an unknown or forgotten
password to a computer or network resources.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.080
The password cracking techniques includes
the following: guessing, brute forcing,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.160
dictionary attack, shoulder
surfing, and social engineering.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.840
Guidelines for Windows Operating System Security

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.560
Over the past several years, the number of
computer security breaches has increased.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:41.200
Most of the operating systems, Windows and Mac
OS, offer peer-to-peer files sharing which may

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.080
expose the computer to various malware programs
or other threats. Guidelines are important and

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.840
help a user to learn best security practices
for securing a windows operating system.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.000
Follow these guidelines for windows
operating system security: (1)

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:09.960
lock the system when not in use; (2) create a
strong password (3) disable the guest account; (4)

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.760
lock out unwanted guests; (5) rename
the administrator account; (6)

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:30.080
disable startup menu; (7) apply security patches;
(8) use windows firewall; (9) use NTFS; (10) use

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:37.760
windows encrypting file system; (11) enable
BitLocker; (12) disable unnecessary services.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:48.000
As well as (13) kill unnecessary processes on
your computer; (14) audit the attackers; (15) hide

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.840
files and folders; (16) disable simple file
sharing; (17) use windows user access control,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.720
and (18) implement malware prevention.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.320
