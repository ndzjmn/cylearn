00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.920
Next will be the wireless network security.
Wireless networks are used to connect the

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.680
computers to each other without any cables.
They have become popular due to the ease of

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.760
installation and the increasing
popularity of laptop computers.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.360
Restaurants, hotels, business centers, apartment
complexes, and individuals often provide wireless

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.880
access with little or no protection. The
network is referred to as a "service set

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.360
identifier". All devices on the network must use
the same SSID to communicate with each other.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.720
The major advantage of wireless
networks is user mobility,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.120
that is within the range of a particular network.
A network has sufficient bandwidth to enable

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.000
a wide range of applications and services such
as police radios, palm pilots, and cell phones.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.400
The main concern has to do with the mobility of
users who expect flawless reception between access

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.880
points. It is not necessary to re-log in and
restore network applications. A wireless exchange

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.720
is possible only if the access points exchange
data with every transfer of one user to another.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.800
Wireless networks provide the freedom to roam with
uninterrupted connectivity. Now, we're going to

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.280
talk about the network security threats.
First on the list is Malware.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.320
Email, instant messaging, and file sharing
programs have traditionally been used to

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.560
spread viruses, worms, back doors, root kits,
trojans, and spyware from computer to computer.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.400
Sniffing
Wi-fi access points can be used

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:16.400
by hackers to set up packet sniffers to monitor
all traffic that comes and goes in a network.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.000
Denial of Service

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.640
It leads the computer to crash or to become so
busy in processing data that it cannot be used.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.920
Mobile Code
either Java, Javascript and ActiveX, intruders use

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.040
a mobile code to gather information from websites
visited or to run malicious code in the computer.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.560
Email Spoofing

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.920
An email message that appears to have
originated from one source when it was

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.240
really sent from another to trick the
user in providing sensitive information.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.840
Chat clients allow the exchange of
executable code that may be malicious.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.120
Being an intermediary for another attack
Intruders use compromised computers for

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.120
attacking other systems. Backdoor
and remote administration programs

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.080
BackOrifice, NetBus and SubSeven

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.240
are the tools commonly used by intruders to
attack windows computer. Cross-site scripting

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.000
It is when a malicious web developer may
attach a script to something sent to a website

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.200
such as a URL that is transferred to your
browser when the website responds to you.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:52.880
Unprotected windows shares can be exploited by
intruders to place distributed attack tools for

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.920
windows based computers attached to the
internet. Securing Network Connections

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.520
To secure network connections, first,
use a firewall. A firewall is a part

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.800
of a computer system or network that is
designed to block unauthorized access.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.320
It controls traffic coming into and leaving the
system by permitting authorized communications.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.440
Examples of software firewalls are Windows
Firewall, Norton personal firewall, McAfee

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.920
personal firewall, Subeit personal firewall,
ZoneAlarm and Comodo personal firewall. Next

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.440
is to use an antivirus protection.
An antivirus is a software used to

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.120
detect viruses and protect the system from
threats. It should be used at the server.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.400
Viruses can be detected using specific or generic
methods. Specific methods look for the exact virus

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.440
while the generic look for virus-like
performance and may cause false alarms.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.000
Anti-virus should be configured to scan all
workstations; the complete network at regular

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.640
intervals; all incoming and outgoing traffic;
email attachments, downloads, and browsing.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.360
Here are some examples of antivirus
software. First is AVG antivirus

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.360
which is a product by the Grisoft company.
It can be downloaded from www.grisoft.com,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:49.360
and like any other antivirus software, it detects
and removes viruses from the system. Norton

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.320
Norton antivirus is a product of Symantec
corporation. It can be downloaded from

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:05.840
www.symantec.com and it can detect and remove
viruses and other malicious codes from the system.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.040
Kaspersky
Kaspersky antivirus provides a

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.000
user with traditional anti-virus protection based
on the latest protection technologies. The user

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.480
can work, communicate, surf the internet, and play
online games on the computer safely and easily.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.560
Next tip would be to use strong passwords.
Password is the first line of defense and

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.880
the user should ensure that the passwords
selected for all user accounts are strong,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.440
and while creating a password, the user should
remember that the password should be: first,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.680
easy to remember. The password must be something
that the user can remember, but not related to the

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:02.720
user. It should not contain any bank information.
Next a password should contain long and multiple

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.480
symbols. A strong password is 8 to 10 digits
long with letters numbers and special characters.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.840
Passwords should also be frequently changing.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.320
Create the schedule to change the password
periodically, and use strong encryption algorithms

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.720
to encrypt the password storage files such as
a security account manager, and passwd.conf

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:38.720
file. Next is password should withstand filters
and resist crackers. Use a filter that operates

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.840
in real time, and reinforces some level
of length and complexity on passwords.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.800
Next step for securing network connections
should be: make regular backups. Regular backups

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.280
help to avoid the loss of critical data or files
which can be accidentally deleted or corrupted.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.520
It helps to restore data during security issues.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.680
The main reasons to backup data include
restoring the critical data after data loss,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.680
and restoring files when they are
accidentally deleted or corrupted.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.480
Know about encryption
Encryption or the conversion of data

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.040
into a unreadable form called ciphertext.
Unencrypted data is called a plain text.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.840
Encryption protects sensitive
information that is transmitted online.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.720
It camouflages the data within a file or message
so that unauthorized users cannot use it.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.400
There are two types of encryption:
asymmetric encryption wherein the user

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.440
uses two keys - one key for encryption
and the other key is for decryption.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.840
Next would be the symmetric encryption which
uses one key for both encryption and decryption.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.960
To summarize the whole lesson, first,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.840
a firewall is part of a computer system or network
that is designed to block unauthorized access.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.920
The router acts as a shield to the
network and manages all communications.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.640
Wireless networks are used to connect the
computers to each other without any cables.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.000
Eavesdropping, data interception,
and modification, denial of service,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.840
spoofing, freeloading, and rogue WLANs are
the common threads to the wireless network.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.880
Sniffing, malware, email spoofing, chat
clients, cross-site scripting, unprotected

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:02.400
windows shares, and mobile code on some of the
network security threats. Lastly, secure network

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:15.760
connections using firewall anti-virus using strong
passwords regular backups encryption, and so on.
