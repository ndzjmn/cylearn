00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.080
For our next lesson, we're going to talk
about Conducting Passive Reconnaissance.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.400
Here is the outline of our lesson: (1) we'll be
talking about passive reconnaissance techniques;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.320
(2) we'll talk about the terminologies and
the (3) we'll be talking about preparation

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:35.440
for the next steps. First is Information
Gathering. It is a process of identifying,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.840
discovering, and obtaining information that
may have relevance to the penetration test.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.840
Second is OSINT or open source intelligence. An
actionable information that has been gathered

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.880
from freely and publicly available sources.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.000
Next is whois. It is a protocol
that supports querying of data

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.360
related to entities who register public
domains and on their internet resources.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.560
This information is available
to anyone who queries databases.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.080
Next, information can also be coming
from the organization's website.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.320
Marketing sites have the potential to be the
OSINT. Most sites have the "About" page. These

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.320
marketing sites provide a following information
such as high profile personnel, upcoming events,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.640
forms to be filled out, user forums, additional
contact information and links to social media.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.560
Social media can also be used
for passive reconnaissance.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.800
Most organizations have some
presence on the social media.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.400
Rich source of information about these individuals
can be found such social media sites like Twitter,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.840
Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube,
Instagram and Reddit may be used.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.000
On job boards, job posts may reveal

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.960
information about the personal structure,
technical environments, and more.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.320
Every employer on job posts needs to entice
and provide enough information to prospective

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.040
applicants amount and type of information
given is dependent on this industry and job.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.480
Next is Google Hacking. It is a
process of using google search engine

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.320
to identify potential security weaknesses. It is
also not considered hacking in a strict sense.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.920
You may extract information from a typical
search. It includes special search operators

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:35.200
to provide more focused results such as site,
link, filetype, intitle, inurl and inanchor.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.000
Information can also be found
in online articles and news.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.080
It can provide insights about the target
organization. Usually, larger businesses are

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.080
featured by mainstream news outlets while
smaller businesses issue press releases.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:13.840
It will not always reveal what you need to know.
This should be a conjunction with other OSINT.
