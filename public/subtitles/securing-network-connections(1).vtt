00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.240
Securing Network Connections.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.840
Here is the outline of the lesson: first, we're
going to talk about home and wireless networks.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.960
Second, wireless network security and
third, securing network connections.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.160
Home and Wireless Networks

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.960
A home network or home networks are
widely used to send emails, schoolwork

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.520
and instant messages as well as to download
music and videos, shop, and play games.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.160
A home network can let them share files
and documents and internet connection,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.960
printers and scanners, stereos, TVs and
game systems as well as DVD and CD burners.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.600
Here are the different network devices.
Router.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.520
It is used for connecting
the modem to the network.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.840
It determines the next network point to which a
packet should be forwarded to its destination.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.840
Hub or Switch
It is a device

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.880
that directs the incoming data from any
of multiple input ports to the specific

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.960
output port that will take the data
toward its intended destination.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.040
Converter
It is used to connect several

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.840
types of cables within an existing
network

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.040
Next is NIC or network interface card which
is a device that joins computers to LANs.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.360
Modem
It is used to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.480
connect the system to the network or internet.
The term modem means "modulator-demodulator".

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.240
It converts digital signals
into analog and vice versa.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.680
Access Point
It is a wireless

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.400
communications hardware that creates a
central point of wireless connectivity.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.120
Gateway

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.280
It is a device that connects
different network environments

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.360
transceiver. It is a network device that has both
a transmitter and receiver. It is used to transmit

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.920
analog or digital signals and the receiver
is used to receive analog or digital signals.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.080
Cable
It is

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.720
used to connect one network device to another.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.600
Terminals are the hardware
devices used to enter data

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:03.520
into computer or to display
data from the computer.
