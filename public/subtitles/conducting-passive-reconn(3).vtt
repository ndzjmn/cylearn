00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.800
Finding Analysis and Weaponization. What is
weaponization? It is the process of turning

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.040
passive reconnaissance results into directions
or launch points for active reconnaissance

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.720
and preliminary attacks. It
analyze findings for content of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:39.360
interest. What is content of interest? It
consists of IP addresses and subdomains external

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.920
and third party domains, key personal
and contact information; information

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.400
that facilitates social engineering tests and
information that reveals specific technologies.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.040
IP Address and Sub Domains. IP address
gained from OSINT will usually be

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.840
public ranges. You can leverage public
IP addresses through active scanning.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.160
External and Third Party Sites. Perform ocean
on partner contractor or other related sites.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.600
How you proceed will depend on
scope and actionable information.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:41.840
Such examples would be glassdoor.com to be used.
People. How you leverage people information

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.880
depends on several factors such as the role
to play in the organization, the day-to-day

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.320
responsibilities, the teams and departments
they work with, business identification such as

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.960
email address and phone numbers, technical
aptitude and mindsets and perspectives.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.800
What is social engineering? Social Engineering
is the practice of deceiving people into giving

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.960
away access to unauthorized parties or enabling
those parties to compromise sensitive assets.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.920
Usually targets are unaware of the trick
commonly used by attackers because of how

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.160
effective it can be. So, this is usually the next
logical step after gathering people-based OSINT.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.000
Technologies. Technology information
can prepare you to exploit specific

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.480
scenarios. On the third lesson of this
module is the preparation for the next steps.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000
First is record your findings and conclusion

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.520
in a document. Choose whichever document
format you're most comfortable with.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.320
Make sure you define what next steps you need to
take on your tests. The direction should depend on

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.000
the scope of the test, findings, and
personal assessment of the situation.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.960
The guidelines for preparing background
findings for the next steps is to, first,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.080
clearly determine what next
steps means for your test.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.360
Analyze the findings to determine
how to weaponize them in the future.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.640
Consider the findings within a bigger picture
and disregard irrelevant findings and focus on

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.920
the actionable findings. Determine how public IP
addresses map to public resources you can target

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:13.840
and consider how public address
might be useful as entry points.
