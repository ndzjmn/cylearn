How to find if you are a victim of identity theft?

Most victims do not realize that their
identity has been stolen until it is too

late. The best method to find out whether or not
an identity has been compromised is by checking

credit score regularly. An early discovery of
a possible identity theft can limit the damage.

The following is a list of indications that your
identity has been stolen: 1. Bill collection

agencies contact the user for overdue debts
that never incurred. 2. Users received bills,

invoices, or receipts addressed to them for
goods or services that they did not ask for.

3. A user's request for a mortgage or any other
loan is rejected citing bad credit history despite

the user maintaining a healthy credit record.
4. You notice that some of your mail seems to be

missing. 5. Users receive mail about an apartment
they never rented; a house they never bought,

or a job they never held. 6. Users lose imported
documents such as a passport or driver's license.

The following are also indications that
your identity has been stolen: Victims

identify irregularities in credit card and bank
statements; Victims are denied social benefits and

users receive a credit card statement for a new
account. What to do if your identity is stolen?

If your identity is stolen,
first, you have to place

fraud alerts on credit card reports and
review credit card reports regularly.

There are two types of fraud alerts: Initial and

Extended. An initial fraud alert stays on
the credit report for at least 90 days.

The users may ask the credit reporting
agency to place a fraud report

or alert on their credit report if they believe
that they are or will be victims of identity

theft. If they have been a victim of a phishing
scam or if they have lost personal belongings that

contain personally identifiable information such
as credit cards and driver's license and more.

An extended fraud report stay on a
credit report for up to seven years.

Users may ask the credit reporting agency
to place a fraud report on the credit report

if they have previously been victims of identity
theft. Users will have to prove their identity

to the credit reporting agency to have a
fraud alert placed on their credit report.

Fraud alerts may help prevent the user's identity
from being used further. Next, close the bank

accounts that have been compromised with or the
accounts that have been opened fraudulently.

The victim should call his or her banks or
creditor security and fraud department. He

or she should also notify the banks and
the credit card companies in writing.

Victims needs to ensure that
they document all conversation

and mail information such as when they
have received mail or so on for future use.

Users should not use the same personal
identification number or pin or password

for any new bank accounts or credit cards they
apply for. For any of the compromised accounts

or new accounts opened fraudulently in the user's
name, the user should also file a dispute with the

company directly. Victims may also choose to
lodge a complaint with the local authorities.
