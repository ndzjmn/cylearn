on our first lesson on cyber
security 2 we're going to talk about

the introduction to penetration testing concepts

here is the flow of our lesson first we're
going to talk about what is penetration testing

second we're going to talk about adopting the
hacker mindset third we're going to talk about the

reasons for penetration testing and fourth we're
going to talk about who performs penetration tests

so what is penetration testing penetration
testing is a highly skilled discipline and

organizations often try to have experienced
penetration testers further testing efforts

penetration testers have the goal to find
vulnerabilities risks or possible threats

that the company may encounter on their systems
cyber security professionals usually have this

goals or what we call the CIA triad and it
is well-known model to describe the goals of

information security first the CIA triad consists
of confidentiality integrity and availability

now we are going to define
this tree first confidentiality

it seeks to prevent unauthorized
access to information or systems

second integrity it seeks to prevent unauthorized
modification of information or systems and third

availability it seeks to ensure that legitimate
use of information and systems remain possible

attackers and therefore penetration testers

seek to undermine these goals and achieve
three corresponding goals of their own

the attacker's goals are known as the DAD triad
which stands for disclosure alteration and denial

now we're going to define the dad triad
first is disclosure it is the opposite

of confidentiality it seeks to gain
unauthorized access to information

and systems next is alteration it seeks to make
unauthorized changes to information or systems

and third denial which seeks to prevent
legitimate use of information or systems

if you're new to cyber security this is the time
to understand the elements of the CIA triad cyber

security defenders do spend the majority of their
time thinking in these terms designing controls

and defenses to protect information and systems
against a wide array of known and unknown threats

penetration testers must take a very different
approach in their thinking instead of trying to

defend against all possible threats they only
need to find a single vulnerability that they

might exploit to achieve their goals to find these
flaws they must think like the adversary who might

attack the system in the real world this approach
is commonly known as adopting the hacker mindset

before we explore the hacker mindset
in terms of technical systems

let's explore it using an
example from the physical world

if you were responsible for the physical
security of an electronic store you might

consider a variety of threats and implement
controls designed to counter those attacks

you'd be worried about shoplifting robbery and
employee embezzlement among other threats and

you might build a system of security controls that
seeks to prevent those threats from materializing

these controls might include the following items

security cameras in high risk areas
auditing of cash register receipts

and tough detectors at main entrance and exit
of the store as well as exit alarms on emergency

exits that's the hacker mindset you need to
think like a criminal there's an important

corollary to the hacker mindset that is important
for both attackers and defenders to keep in mind

when conducting a penetration test or a real-world
attack the attacker only needs to win once

they might attempt hundreds or thousands of
potential attacks against a target the fact

that an organization's security defenses block
99.99 of those attacks is irrelevant if one of the

attacks succeed cyber security professionals need
to win every time attackers only need to win once
