00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.360
Malware Types
Here is the outline of the lesson: First, we're

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.360
going to talk about the malware attacks, and next
we're going to talk about the types of malware

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.280
malware attacks.
In the most recent report,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.000
there were 5.6 billion malware
attacks carried out in 2020

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.720
compared to the 9.9 billion attacks in
the previous years. Knowing this report,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.320
it is important to know what common types of
attacks happening in this era of technology.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.640
Now we're going to talk about the definitions
of the different attacks of malware. First is

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.280
Delivery. It means or defines how the malware
gets to the target. Next will be Propagation.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:04.240
It is defined as how the malware spreads. Payload
What the malware does once it's there on its

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:14.080
target system or devices, and lastly Indicators
of Compromise or IOC. It is an artifact observed

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.000
on a network or in an operating system that with
high confidence indicates a computer intrusion.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840
Now, we are going to talk
about the types of malware.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:37.280
Based on the report of Symantec, last 2018, there
were 246 million new malware variants discovered,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.480
and about an increase of 25 percent of groups
use destructive malware during that time.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.960
As malware usage continues to rise, it
is important to know what malware types

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.360
are there and what we can do to protect
our data and network from these malware.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.160
Listed on the screen are the types of malware
and we are going to define each. So first are

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.920
the viruses. What are viruses? there are types
of viruses such as the armored virus which is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.160
a virus that is protected in a way that makes
disassembling it difficult. The difficulty makes

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.520
it "armored" against antivirus programs that have
trouble getting to and understanding its code.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.680
So next one would be the companion virus.
It is a virus that creates a new program

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.600
that runs in the place of an expected program of
the same name. So, it's like a duplicate or an

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.600
imposter kind of virus. The next one would be the
macro virus. It is a software exploitation virus

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.440
that works by using the macro feature included
in many applications such as Microsoft Office.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:09.120
So, multipartite is also a virus that
attacks a system in more than one way.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.520
So, here are more viruses or kinds of
virus such as the phage virus which

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.120
can modify or alter the
programs and the databases.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:37.200
For the polymorphic virus, it is a virus that
changes form. It is quite different with the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:46.560
phage virus so it changes its form in order to
avoid the detection of the antivirus program.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.680
Next one would be the retrovirus, which is a virus
that attacks or bypass the antivirus software

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.040
installed on a computer, and the last one would be
the stealth virus which is a virus that attempts

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:13.840
to avoid detection by the antivirus software,
and it can remain inside the operating system.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.680
Next is crypto malware and ransomware. So what
is a crypto malware? it is a malware that uses

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.840
cryptography. What is cryptography? it is a
practice or a study of techniques to secure

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:44.320
communication in the presence of the third party.
Basically, it uses encryption to protect the data

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.960
but in this type of malware, it uses cryptography
as part of the attack. It prevents users from

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.240
accessing their system or personal files through
encryption and demands ransom payment in order

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:10.080
to gain access. So, it's a bit related with
ransomware. So wherein ransomware, the authors

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.240
of the ransomware order that payment be sent via
cryptocurrency online payments or credit card.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.120
So here are some examples like Cryptolocker,
WannaCry, Locky, zCrypt and NotPetra.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.080
Rootkit
It is a malware

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.840
designed to provide continuous privileged access
to a computer while actively hiding its presence.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.120
It is a malware that has the ability to obtain
administrative access or root-level access

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.520
and hide itself from the operating system.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.520
Trojan or Trojan horse has the same
meaning of where its name came from,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:03.440
which is from the story of Troy. So, Trojan
horse is a malware that looks legitimate but

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.760
does something malicious to its target system. One
of the major differences between a trojan horse

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.240
and a virus is that trojan horses
tend not to replicate themselves.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:26.720
Next is worms. This is a malware that can
replicate copies of themselves within the system

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:34.640
without the knowledge of the user. These worms or
this malware can exploit a vulnerability on the

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.560
target system or use social engineering
to trick users into executing itself.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:49.440
It has the advantage during the file transport,
and it can travel to different systems unaided.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.880
Logic or time bomb
It is an application

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:04.000
or a malware hidden within an application that
causes something to happen based on some criteria

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.120
being met. An example of this is when a programmer
could create a program that always makes sure his

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.760
or her name appears on the payroll roster, and
if it doesn't, the key files begin to be erased.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:29.600
Keyloggers is a type of malware wherein users are
unaware that their actions are being tracked. This

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:38.560
is a form of spyware and usually, software for
keyloggers stores your keystrokes in a small file

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.640
which can be accessed later by the person
monitoring your actions. Some actions that can

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:54.160
be monitored are key pressed from a keyboard,
mouse clicks, screen recorders or scrapers.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.840
Bots, as defined, are zombie computers due
to their ability to operate on the remote

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:12.080
direction without their owner's knowledge. A bot
is a software program that collects information

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:21.520
on the web. A botnet is a network of compromised
computers under the control of a malicious actor.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.480
The malicious actor is called
a bot herders or bot masters.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.840
Backdoor is an undocumented way of accessing
the system usually when normal authentication

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.480
mechanisms are being bypassed. An example
of this is when there is an opening left

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:51.760
in a program application usually by the developer
which allows access to the system or data.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.880
This can be a way for
attackers to enter your system.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.440
RATs or Remote Access Trojans
or Remote Administration Tools

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.080
It is a software that remotely gives a
person full control of the technological

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.680
device. It allows covert surveillance or the
ability to gain unauthorized access to a victim

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:28.320
PC. It provides the capability for an
attacker to gain unauthorized remote access

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.840
to the victim machine while specifically or
specially configured communication protocols.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.120
Spyware or Adware
These are applications

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.840
that covertly monitors your online behavior
without your users' knowledge or permission.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.480
APT is a set of stealthy and
continuous computer hacking processes,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.240
often orchestrated by a person or
persons targeting a specific entity.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.960
The advanced process signifies sophisticated
techniques using malware to exploit

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.520
vulnerabilities in systems. The persistent
process suggests that an external command

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.600
and control system is continuously monitoring
and extracting data from a specific target.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:42.720
The threat process indicates that human
involvement in orchestrating the attack.
