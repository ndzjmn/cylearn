00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.200
on our first lesson on cyber
security 2 we're going to talk about

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.160
the introduction to penetration testing concepts

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.280
here is the flow of our lesson first we're
going to talk about what is penetration testing

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.440
second we're going to talk about adopting the
hacker mindset third we're going to talk about the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.040
reasons for penetration testing and fourth we're
going to talk about who performs penetration tests

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.200
so what is penetration testing penetration
testing is a highly skilled discipline and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.760
organizations often try to have experienced
penetration testers further testing efforts

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.520
penetration testers have the goal to find
vulnerabilities risks or possible threats

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.280
that the company may encounter on their systems
cyber security professionals usually have this

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.560
goals or what we call the CIA triad and it
is well-known model to describe the goals of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:34.560
information security first the CIA triad consists
of confidentiality integrity and availability

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.760
now we are going to define
this tree first confidentiality

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.000
it seeks to prevent unauthorized
access to information or systems

00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:00.080
second integrity it seeks to prevent unauthorized
modification of information or systems and third

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.360
availability it seeks to ensure that legitimate
use of information and systems remain possible

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.640
attackers and therefore penetration testers

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.600
seek to undermine these goals and achieve
three corresponding goals of their own

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.720
the attacker's goals are known as the DAD triad
which stands for disclosure alteration and denial

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.960
now we're going to define the dad triad
first is disclosure it is the opposite

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.680
of confidentiality it seeks to gain
unauthorized access to information

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:58.240
and systems next is alteration it seeks to make
unauthorized changes to information or systems

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.840
and third denial which seeks to prevent
legitimate use of information or systems

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.120
if you're new to cyber security this is the time
to understand the elements of the CIA triad cyber

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.400
security defenders do spend the majority of their
time thinking in these terms designing controls

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.040
and defenses to protect information and systems
against a wide array of known and unknown threats

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.000
penetration testers must take a very different
approach in their thinking instead of trying to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.560
defend against all possible threats they only
need to find a single vulnerability that they

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.680
might exploit to achieve their goals to find these
flaws they must think like the adversary who might

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:05.760
attack the system in the real world this approach
is commonly known as adopting the hacker mindset

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.120
before we explore the hacker mindset
in terms of technical systems

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.360
let's explore it using an
example from the physical world

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.240
if you were responsible for the physical
security of an electronic store you might

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.520
consider a variety of threats and implement
controls designed to counter those attacks

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.640
you'd be worried about shoplifting robbery and
employee embezzlement among other threats and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.960
you might build a system of security controls that
seeks to prevent those threats from materializing

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.720
these controls might include the following items

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.840
security cameras in high risk areas
auditing of cash register receipts

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.240
and tough detectors at main entrance and exit
of the store as well as exit alarms on emergency

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:15.680
exits that's the hacker mindset you need to
think like a criminal there's an important

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.080
corollary to the hacker mindset that is important
for both attackers and defenders to keep in mind

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.720
when conducting a penetration test or a real-world
attack the attacker only needs to win once

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.800
they might attempt hundreds or thousands of
potential attacks against a target the fact

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:47.600
that an organization's security defenses block
99.99 of those attacks is irrelevant if one of the

00:05:47.600 --> 00:06:04.160
attacks succeed cyber security professionals need
to win every time attackers only need to win once
