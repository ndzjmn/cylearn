00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the second topic of Cybersecurity

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.300
One

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.700
Security Control and Framework Types. Here's the outline

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.000
of the lesson, First, we're going to talk about the various

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.200
types of control, and Second, we'll be talking about Framework

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Types. The first type of control is preventive controls.

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.100
It prevents any security breach from occuring.

8
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.700
It is aimed at preventing an incident from occuring.

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.300
Examples of these preventive controls are security guards,

10
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.400
biometrics and security cameras. Detective controls.

11
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.800
This attempt to detect any break in that has already happened.

12
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.200
It aims to detect incidents after they have occured.

13
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.800
Such tools to be used are security audit, visual surveillance

14
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.700
system and motion detection system.

15
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.900
Next is Corrective controls.

16
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.500
It attempts to reverse the impact of an incident or problem

17
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.200
after it has occured.

18
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.300
It aims to reverse the impact of an incident.

19
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Such examples we use or actions to be do

20
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.900
are intrusion detection system, backups and system recovery.

21
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.300
Next is Deterrent controls, which attempts to prevent incidents

22
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.200
by discouraging threats.

23
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.100
It aims to discourage individuals from causing accident.

24
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.600
Such examples of tools that can be used in this control are

25
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.700
cable locks and hardware locks.

26
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.600
Compensating controls

27
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.500
These are alternative controls used when a primary control

28
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600
is not visible.

29
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.800
Such examples of this are time-based one-time password and

30
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.500
pin number.

31
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.100
Next, we're going to talk about the Cybersecurity Framework

32
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.800
types. The first framework type would be NIST Cybersecurity

33
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.600
Framework. It is established by the National Institute of

34
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58:700
Standards and Technology and most widely used by American

35
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.900
companies. It offers the assurance of having being developed

36
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08:000
by US federal government in collaboration with private businesses.

37
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.200
It offers detailed guidance on everything from risk assessment

38
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.500
and continuous monitoring to incident response and awareness

39
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.400
training. Next on the list is ISO, which is designed to provide

40
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.500
a framework for achieving a certified level of data security

41
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.400
compliance that needs external assessment standards.

42
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.800
It is developed by the International Organization of Standardization

43
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.300
and the International Electrotechnical Commission.

44
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.900
It is designed to ensure a level of data privacy and confidentiality

45
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.400
that not only helps companies avoid prosecution but also

46
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.700
to maximize operational efficiencies through reduction of

47
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100
vulnerability to disruptive attacks.

48
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.400
Next is the Critical Security Controls Framework developed

49
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.800
by the Sans Institute.

50
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.900
It offers an expert level understanding of cybersecurity,

51
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.600
and it is a claim for breaking down those insights into three

52
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.900
manageable and actionable categories.

53
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.700
This framework provides a defense mechanism to ensure that 

54
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.300
authorized personnel are accessing appropriate data and assets.

55
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.800
Last on the list is COBIT, which stands for Control Objectives

56
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
for Information-related Technology.

57
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.000
It is designed to guarantee the integrity of organization's

58
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.500
data infrastructure from operational perspective.

59
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.800
It offers a tool for managers to assess risks and eliminate

60
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.500
weak spots

61
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.000
from a big perspective.

62
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08:800
It also provides a means for ensuring data security while

63
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.900
avoiding the wasted resources that come with the application

64
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.400
effort.
