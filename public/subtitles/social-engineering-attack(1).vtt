00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.520
With millions of individuals becoming
victims of identity theft, each year,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.160
billions of dollars lost and the amount of time
victims have to spend to rebuild their credit.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.040
Identity theft is a menace that
is only getting bigger each day.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.160
This module will explain what identity theft is
and how users can protect themselves from it.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.280
This module will familiarize you with:

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:46.400
(1) identity theft; (2) social engineering; (3)
how to find if you are a victim of identity theft;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.840
(4) what to do if identity is stolen;
(5) protecting from identity theft.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.080
Identity Theft

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.840
What is Identity Theft? Individuals work
hard to support themselves or their family

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.840
they keep their credit card scores
clean and yearn for the benefits that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.880
accompany good credit but they would
be really frustrated if someone else

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.960
uses their name to apply for credit cards run
bills of thousands of dollars using the card,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.960
opens bank accounts in their name or
worse yet, commits a crime in their name.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.840
Identity theft or Identity fraud refers to
crimes in which a person wrongfully obtains

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.960
key pieces of personal identifying information
such as date of birth, social security numbers,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.800
and driver's license numbers, and uses them
for their own personal gain. Fraudsters

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.680
create a persona similar to the victim and take
advantage of his or her authority and privileges.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.840
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of
2003 or FACTA defines identity theft as a fraud

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.520
committed using the identifying information
of another person. Identifying information

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.880
according to the Federal Trade Commission, is
another name or any number that may be used

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.840
alone or in combination with any other
information to identify a specific individual.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.360
Identifying information includes name,
social security number, and date of birth.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.720
Official state, or government issued driver's
license, or identification number, alien

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.920
registration number, government passport number,
and employer, or taxpayer identification number.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.080
Unique biometric data such as fingerprint voice
print retina or iris image and other unique

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.520
physical representations. It may also include
unique electronic identification, number address,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.480
or routing code, and lastly telecommunication
identifying information or access device.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.080
Personal information that can be stolen are the
following: all identity thief needs is a piece of

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.560
personal information which may include
names, addresses, date of birth,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.640
mother's maiden name, telephone numbers, social
security numbers, driver's license number,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.280
credit card, or bank account numbers,
birth certificates and passport numbers.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.000
So, how do attackers steal identity? There are two
methods: the first one is the physical methods.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.040
First is stealing computers laptops and
backup media: stealing is a common method

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.280
the thieves steal hardware from places such as
hotels and recreational places such as clubs

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.720
or government organizations. Given adequate time,
they can recover valuable data from this media.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.200
Social engineering: this technique is the act of
manipulating people's trust to perform certain

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.640
actions or divulge private information
without using technical cracking methods.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.000
Next is Theft of personal belongings

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.840
Wallets or purses usually contain a
person's credit cards and driver's license

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.960
attackers may steal the belongings
on streets or in other busy areas.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:11.600
Next is mail theft and rerouting: mail boxes
are not often protected and may contain bank

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.160
documents such as credit cards or account
statements, administrative forms and more.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.760
Criminals may use this information to get credit
cards or for rerouting the mail to a new address.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.600
next is shoulder surfing:

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.400
criminals may find user information by glancing
at documents personal identification numbers

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.400
typed into an automatic teller machine
or ATM, or overhearing conversations.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.240
Skimming refers to stealing credit or debit
card numbers by using a special storage device

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:05.440
when processing the card. While pretexting, our
fraudsters may pose as executives from financial

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.400
institutions telephone companies and other sources
to obtain personal information of the user.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:23.360
Another method in how attackers still identity is
the internet methods. Pharming is an advanced form

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.200
of phishing in which the connection between the
IP address and its target server is redirected.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.800
The attacker may use cache poisoning or modify
the internet address with that of a rogue address

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.920
to do this. When the user types in the internet
address, he or she is redirected to the rogue

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.840
website that is similar to the original
website. Keyloggers and password stealers.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.680
An attacker may infect the user's
computer with trojans and then collect it

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.800
such as keyword strokes to steal passwords,
usernames and other sensitive information.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.280
Phishing. the fraudster may pretend to be
a financial institution or from a reputed

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.680
organization and sends spam or pop-up messages
to trick the users to reveal their personal

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:32.240
information. And last on the internet methods
is hacking, wherein attackers may compromise

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:40.560
user systems and route information using listening
devices such as sniffers and scanners. Attackers

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.280
gain access to an abundance of data decrypt
it if necessary and use it for identity theft.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:58.400
What do attackers do with stolen identity? in
credit card fraud: the attackers may use the

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:05.920
information to route the mail to a new residential
address. The criminal may also use the information

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.840
to apply for a new credit card in the victim's
name and run high bills using the credit cards.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.280
In phone or utilities fraud: the attacker
may apply for a new phone contract

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.200
or a wireless connection and run up
bills in user's name. They may also use

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.760
user information to obtain utility services
such as electricity, heating, or cable TV.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:42.320
In bank or finance fraud: the attacker may
generate forged checks using the victim's name

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:49.600
or account number. They may also open a bank
account in the victim's name and write bad checks.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:58.000
The criminal may also duplicate the user's ATM
or debit card and withdraw money thus depleting

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.720
the victim's bank resources and lastly the
attackers can also apply for bank loans.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.320
In government documents fraud: the
attacker can obtain a driver's license,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.520
state id and more, with the user's name and
the criminal's picture. They can also obtain

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.200
social security benefits and other government
benefits that rightfully belong to the user.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:35.840
They may also file tax returns in a
user's name and obtain tax benefits.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.440
Other frauds may include the following
such as acquiring a job using the

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:52.560
user's social security number or SSN, and listing
a house in the user's name. Social Engineering.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.160
Social engineering is the art of convincing
people to reveal confidential information.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.000
It is a trick used to gain sensitive
information by exploiting basic human nature.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.360
Social engineers attempt to gather the
following: such as when criminals aim to

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.400
gather sensitive information such as credit card
details, social security number, passwords, and

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:28.000
other personal information, and more. The types
of social engineering includes the following:

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.840
human-based social engineering and
computer-based social engineering.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.800
For human-based social engineering it is using
a direct interactions with key individuals

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.640
in an organization to exploit or manipulate people
into providing the confidential information.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.960
These attacks mainly use impersonation
and its methods include the following:

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.840
eavesdropping, shoulder
surfing, and dumpster diving.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.760
In human based social engineering, eavesdropping

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.480
is an unauthorized listening
of conversations or reading of

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.760
messages. It is the interception of any form of
communication such as audio video or written.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.120
For shoulder surfing, it is a procedure
where the attacker look over the user's

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.360
shoulder to gain critical information such
as passwords, personal identification number,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:41.920
account numbers, credit card information, and
more. For the dumpster diving, it includes

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:48.320
searching for sensitive information at the
target company's trash bins, printer trash bins

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:55.840
and user desk for sticky notes and more. Next
is the computer-based social engineering.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:04.560
There are three methods of computer-based social
engineering which includes pop-up windows which

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.840
suddenly pop up while surfing the internet and
ask for users information to log in or sign up.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:19.360
Hoax letters which are emails that issue warnings
to the user on new viruses trojans or worms that

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.920
may harm the user system, and lastly the chain
letters which are emails that offer free gifts

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.280
such as money and software on the condition
that the user has to forward the mail to the

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:39.600
said number of persons. Next is the instant chat
messenger wherein attackers use instant messaging

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.760
to gather personal information by chatting with
the selected online user to get information like

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:55.360
birth dates and media names. Lastly, spam email
which is irrelevant, unwanted, and unsolicited

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.360
email to collect financial information, social
security numbers, and network information.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:10.880
Computer-based social engineering also includes
the following methods such as phishing which is

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:18.240
an illegitimate email falsely claiming to be from
a legitimate site that attempts to acquire the

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:25.440
user's personal information. Phishing emails
or pop-ups redirect users to fake web pages

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:33.840
of mimicking trustworthy sites that ask
them to submit their personal information.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.440
Next is phony security alerts.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.880
Phony security alerts are the emails or pop-up
windows that seem to be from required hardware

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:54.400
or software manufacturers like Microsoft,
Dell and more. It warns or alerts the user

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.840
that the system is infected and thus will provide
with an attachment or a link to patch the system.
