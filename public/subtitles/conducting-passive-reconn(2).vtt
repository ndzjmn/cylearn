00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.320
This is the continuation of the discussion
for the passive reconnaissance techniques.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.320
DNS querying queries for name resolution
information can reveal the target's network

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.440
structure. Standard queries identify IP
addresses associated with domain name.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.880
Advanced queries retrieve additional DNS records

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.400
and some querying tools may be used
such as nslookup and dig in Linux.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.600
Email addresses one of the most useful elements
of contact information is an email address.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.000
The main point of contact for most organizations

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.240
is also email addresses so email addresses
are also commonly used as account names.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.080
Enumerating email-based DNS records is also
useful for conducting passive reconnaissance.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.400
Shodan is a search engine that enables anyone to
connect to public or improperly secure devices

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880
that allow remote access through the internet.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.760
An example scenario is when a zoo sets up an
IP camera for anyone to watch the animals.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.520
Shodan indexes the connection and
allows anyone to search for it.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.560
Most devices found in shodan are
improperly secured or not secured at all.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.640
theHarvester. It is an open source
OSINT tool that gathers several

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.280
different types of background information
on a target. It gathers subdomain names,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.840
employee names, email addresses, PGP key entries,
and open ports as well as service banners.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.480
theHarvester uses general search
engines such as Google and Bing.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.920
Recon-NG it is a command line open
source for gathering OSINT data.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.840
The functions of recon ng are similar
to the harvester but more robust.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.680
Maltego. it is a graphical awesome
tool that can gather a wide variety

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.720
of information on public resources;
Features awesome objects graphically

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.680
and with links to the other objects it helps
the user to visualize OSINT relationships

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.400
Foca. Foca or known as Fingerprinting
Organizations with Collected

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.200
Archives is a GUI OSINT tool that
discovers metadata that may be

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.280
hidden within documents. It documents
typically downloaded files from the web

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.520
it can also work with variety of the document
types such as office, open document, and more.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.760
It uses a search engine like google to identify
files. It extracts useful metadata such as names

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.520
software, or operating system versions ,
printer information, and plain text passwords

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.560
Here are the following guidelines
for gathering background information.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.800
First, understand that not all
gathered information will be useful.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.840
Second, understand the difference between
OSINT and closed-source intelligence.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.400
Third, recognize which sources provide
OSINT and which do not. Fourth,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.760
perform whois queries to obtain
registration information.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.440
Fifth, examine organization's main site for
personal and business information. Sixth,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.480
look for related sites to
corroborate or expand your OSINT.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.200
Seventh, look over social media
profiles for revealing information.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.120
Eight, search job boards for personal
issues or technology information.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.880
Ninth, conduct google hacking to run
advanced queries on websites and then

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.840
the last on this page, examine news articles
to stay up to date on target's business.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:22.320
Here are more guidelines for
gathering background information.
