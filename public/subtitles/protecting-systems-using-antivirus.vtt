Here is the lesson flow: (1)
introduction to antivirus software;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.480
(2) how does antivirus software work and
(3) choosing the best antivirus software.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.840
Introduction to Antivirus Software

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.440
A computer plugged into the internet is always
at high risk and it is always recommended

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.480
to install antivirus software onto the
system. A computer virus can degrade

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.280
the performance of a computer and delete stored
computer data. Viruses usually spread through

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.560
networks by means of download, email and shared
disk. If an infected file is attached to these

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.320
sources then the system is likely to become
infected upon opening the infected files.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.840
Some of the symptoms indicating viral infection
are improper functioning of applications.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.360
Slow operation and unusual error message, frequent
hanging, frequent restarting, problem sprinting,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.520
double extension on any attachment, and distorted
menus and dialog boxes. An antivirus program

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.120
scans the hard drive and floppy disk to protect
the computer against viruses, worms, spywares,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.400
trojans and more. It ensures that the system is
healthy and alerts the person to implement safety

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.000
measures against harmful attacks. Regularly update
the antivirus software by subscribing to the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.040
updates from anti-virus vendors whenever offered.
The virus dictionary and the suspicious behavior

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.720
approaches are the most widely used approaches
by antivirus software to detect malware.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.840
The Need for Antivirus Program

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.840
When a PC is connected to the internet, the
PC has to combat different malicious programs

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.320
such as viruses, worms,
trojans, spyware, and more.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.520
Cyber criminals such as attackers, and hackers
use these malicious programs as tools to steal

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.720
important information such as personal data
stored in the computer. Due to the invasion of

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.040
malicious programs in the cyberspace, antivirus
programs have become necessary for computers.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.240
How does antivirus software work?
Most of the commercial antivirus

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.600
software used two techniques: First, one
would be the virus dictionary approach

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.840
and the second one would be detecting
suspicious behavior from a computer program.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.560
First one is the virus dictionary approach.
The antivirus software refers to the dictionary

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.160
of known viruses identified by the
author of the antivirus software.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.000
The antivirus software can delete the file repair
the file by removing the virus or quarantine it to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.880
make the file inaccessible to other programs. To
be successful, this approach requires the virus

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.760
dictionary to be updated with periodic online
downloads. The antivirus software usually examines

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.120
files when the OS creates opens and closes
the files as well as when they are emailed.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.520
The software can be normally scheduled on
the hard disk to regularly examine the files.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.840
The suspicious behavior approach include the
following: In this approach, the antivirus

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.880
software monitors the behavior of all programs
instead of identifying the known viruses. Whenever

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.240
the program its suspicious behavior is found the
software alerts the user and asks what to do.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.480
This approach provides protection against new
viruses that do not exist in virus dictionaries.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.800
There are other ways to detect viruses. First one
would be antivirus software will try to emulate

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.640
the beginning of each new executable code that
is being executed before transferring control to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.400
the executable. If the program seems to be a virus
or using self-modifying code, then it immediately

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.280
examines the other executable programs. This
approach results in more false positives.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.440
Sandbox is another kind of detection method
that emulates the OS and runs the executable

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.720
in situation. The sandbox is examined for a virus

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.240
after the termination of a program. It
is performed during an on-demand scans.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.960
Choosing the Best Antivirus Software

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.800
When purchasing an anti-virus software,
look for certain features and choose the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.920
one that can best serve your needs. The
most important things to consider are:

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.880
In antivirus scanning there should be antivirus
detection accuracy which ensures that the

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.160
anti-virus software scans and detects viruses
accurately and detects the majority of threats.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.640
For the scanning speed, ensure that
the anti-virus software can perform

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.960
the task quickly and efficiently. For resource
utilization, ensures that the anti-virus software

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.840
utilizes minimal resources and does not affect
system performance when scanning the computer.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.560
Next things to consider are the hacker
blocking which prevents other users from

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.880
gaining unauthorized access and stealing important
data such as passwords and other confidential

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.960
information. Next is the bidirectional firewall,
ensure that the antivirus software is equipped

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.680
with a software firewall to scan both incoming and
outgoing traffic. Next is the technical support,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:45.520
look for good technical support so issues can be
solved easily. Parental controls - ensure that the

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.040
antivirus program has parental control features
so children can browse the internet safely.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.520
Next is the easy installation the antivirus
software should be user friendly and easy to use.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.400
The antivirus must also be on demand and

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.200
has a scheduled scanning. Allows you to schedule
a scan according to a user specified time

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.760
users can schedule the scan daily weekly or
monthly. The last three things to consider

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.320
in choosing the best antivirus software are
the automatic updates which keeps the user

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.360
abreast of the latest online threats without
the user having to visit the vendor's website.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.920
Spyware detection and prevention which
checks for the anti-spyware components

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.800
keep spyware at bay and lastly, email
scanning email protection that can monitor

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.920
POP and SMTP ports and ensure that the emails
do not contain threat to your computer.
