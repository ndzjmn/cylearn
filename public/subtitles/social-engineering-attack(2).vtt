How to find if you are a victim of identity theft?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.200
Most victims do not realize that their
identity has been stolen until it is too

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.000
late. The best method to find out whether or not
an identity has been compromised is by checking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.840
credit score regularly. An early discovery of
a possible identity theft can limit the damage.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.280
The following is a list of indications that your
identity has been stolen: 1. Bill collection

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.840
agencies contact the user for overdue debts
that never incurred. 2. Users received bills,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.760
invoices, or receipts addressed to them for
goods or services that they did not ask for.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.760
3. A user's request for a mortgage or any other
loan is rejected citing bad credit history despite

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.360
the user maintaining a healthy credit record.
4. You notice that some of your mail seems to be

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.760
missing. 5. Users receive mail about an apartment
they never rented; a house they never bought,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:28.800
or a job they never held. 6. Users lose imported
documents such as a passport or driver's license.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.080
The following are also indications that
your identity has been stolen: Victims

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:48.000
identify irregularities in credit card and bank
statements; Victims are denied social benefits and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.800
users receive a credit card statement for a new
account. What to do if your identity is stolen?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.000
If your identity is stolen,
first, you have to place

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.960
fraud alerts on credit card reports and
review credit card reports regularly.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.800
There are two types of fraud alerts: Initial and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.720
Extended. An initial fraud alert stays on
the credit report for at least 90 days.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.240
The users may ask the credit reporting
agency to place a fraud report

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.120
or alert on their credit report if they believe
that they are or will be victims of identity

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.680
theft. If they have been a victim of a phishing
scam or if they have lost personal belongings that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.880
contain personally identifiable information such
as credit cards and driver's license and more.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.120
An extended fraud report stay on a
credit report for up to seven years.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.520
Users may ask the credit reporting agency
to place a fraud report on the credit report

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.920
if they have previously been victims of identity
theft. Users will have to prove their identity

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.800
to the credit reporting agency to have a
fraud alert placed on their credit report.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:22.560
Fraud alerts may help prevent the user's identity
from being used further. Next, close the bank

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.440
accounts that have been compromised with or the
accounts that have been opened fraudulently.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.320
The victim should call his or her banks or
creditor security and fraud department. He

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.960
or she should also notify the banks and
the credit card companies in writing.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.040
Victims needs to ensure that
they document all conversation

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.160
and mail information such as when they
have received mail or so on for future use.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.760
Users should not use the same personal
identification number or pin or password

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.240
for any new bank accounts or credit cards they
apply for. For any of the compromised accounts

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.680
or new accounts opened fraudulently in the user's
name, the user should also file a dispute with the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.000
company directly. Victims may also choose to
lodge a complaint with the local authorities.
